Defining a function to create a table(named stuffsToPlot)

Then in the table stuffToPlot, we need to define our data variable name and their own data type

Table Data Types
INTEGER - Integer
REAL - Float
TEXT - String
NULL - Null/NaN
BLOB - A Blob of Value (Stored exactly as it was input)
#########################################
You will also notice that there are some uppercase and lowercase letters, it is just some kind of convention to follow

UPPERCASE - code that are for sql
lowercase - code that is not for sql
